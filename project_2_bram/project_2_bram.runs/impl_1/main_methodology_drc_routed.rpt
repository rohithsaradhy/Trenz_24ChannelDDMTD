2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks CLK_REF_N and clk_pl_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks CLK_REF_N] -to [get_clocks clk_pl_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_pl_0 and CLK_REF_N are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_pl_0] -to [get_clocks CLK_REF_N]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks CLK_REF_N and clk_pl_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks CLK_REF_N] -to [get_clocks clk_pl_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#2 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_pl_0 and CLK_REF_N are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_pl_0] -to [get_clocks CLK_REF_N]
